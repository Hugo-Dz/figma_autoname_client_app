# 🪄 Figma Autoname plugin

Your today’s problem with this “Frame 563” is not really renaming it properly to “Button”, it’s more about the 562 other frames you have
to rename too. This plugin is an experiment to solve your problem right here, right now. Prototyped in a few nights in Paris by
[Hugo](https://www.hugoduprez.com/),
the usage of the plugin is completely free. The code is Open Source, that way all designers and developers can make
it better and finally, have more pleasure doing their work.

## 🚧 Enable debug mode

![Debug mode interface](https://i.ibb.co/DkTzpMw/debug-Mode.png)

The debug mode show the frame sent to the model as an image inside the plugin, which can help to see what's the "model see". There are
also some log information about the prediction process in the Figma console.

- Go to `src`/`utils`/`debugMode.ts` and change the variable `isDebugMode` value to `true`.

By default the image displayed is the last in the the child tree of selected nodes. If you want to see only the selected frame,
got to `src`/`code.ts` and change the variable `selectOnlyTopLevelNodes` value to `true`.
